# Project-2
Project 2 for COP 4600

# Notes
My versions of the code work on both of my computers and the student cluster, but don't work on gradescope.  I'm working with the professor to determine the issue.

# Versions
There are currently 3 versions, v0, v1, and v2.
v0 is the code provided by the professor.
v1 was written by me.  It essentially runs 20 copies of the professor's code.
v2 modifies v1 to compress each file in its own thread.

# Usage
make
Compiles the current version

make [v0, v1, v2]
Compiles the selected version
